## 📊 Project Portfolio

### Project 1: Natural Gas Storage Contract Pricing

**Notebook:** [`JPMC_Gas_Contracts.ipynb`]([./JPMC_Gas_Contracts.ipynb](https://github.com/thylinao1/JPMC-Quantitative-Researcher/blob/main/JPMC%20Gas%20Contracts.ipynb))  
**Domain:** Commodities Trading | **Techniques:** Time Series, Derivatives Pricing

#### Problem Statement
Commodity traders need to value storage contracts allowing clients to:
- **Inject** gas during low-price periods (summer)
- **Store** inventory in underground facilities  
- **Withdraw** and sell during high-price periods (winter)

**Contract NPV = (Withdrawal Revenue - Injection Cost) - Storage Fees - Transaction Costs**

#### Solution Architecture

**Phase 1: Price Forecasting (Task 1 Part 1)**
```python
# Model: Polynomial + Seasonal Decomposition
f(t) = a + b·t + c·t² + d·sin(2πt/12) + e·cos(2πt/12)
```
- **Data:** Monthly gas prices (Oct 2020 - Sep 2024)
- **Approach:** Curve fitting with scipy.optimize.curve_fit
- **Extrapolation:** 12-month forward curve
- **Validation:** RMSE, R², residual analysis

**Phase 2: Contract Valuation (Task 1 Part 2)**
- **Inputs:** Injection/withdrawal dates & volumes, storage costs, capacity limits
- **Logic:** Multi-date cash flow analysis with volume validation
- **Output:** Net present value (NPV) of storage contract

#### Key Results
- **Forecast R²:** 0.85+ on historical data
- **Seasonality:** Clear summer trough / winter peak captured
- **Production Function:** `get_price_for_date(date) → price`
- **Risk Management:** Volume checker prevents over-injection

**Business Impact:** Enables confident contract quoting, capturing $/MMBtu seasonal arbitrage

### Project 2: Credit Risk Analytics Suite

**Notebooks:** [`Risk_Estimation.ipynb`](./Risk_Estimation.ipynb) | [`Bucket_FICO_scores.ipynb`](./Bucket_FICO_scores.ipynb)  
**Domain:** Retail Banking Risk | **Techniques:** XGBoost, Dynamic Programming

---

#### Part 1: Probability of Default (PD) Model (Task 2 Part 1)

**Objective:** Predict loan default likelihood for capital provisioning

**Feature Engineering:**
```python
# Risk indicators
debt_to_income = total_debt / income
loan_to_income = loan_amount / income
credit_utilization = loan_outstanding / credit_lines
```

**Model Architecture:**
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Classifier with GridSearchCV
- **Hyperparameters:** Learning rate [0.01-0.03], max_depth [3-8], n_estimators [100-500]
- **Validation:** 5-fold stratified cross-validation

**Performance:**
- **Test AUC:** 0.9998 (near-perfect discrimination)
- **Top Features:** Debt-to-income, FICO score, employment tenure
- **Expected Loss:** `Loan × PD × (1 - Recovery Rate)` with 10% recovery assumption

**Business Impact:** Accurate portfolio loss estimation for regulatory capital (Basel III compliance)

---

#### Part 2: FICO Score Quantization (Task 2 Part 2)

**Objective:** Optimally bucket continuous FICO scores (300-850) into discrete categories

**Mathematical Approach - Log-Likelihood Maximization:**
```
LL(b₁, ..., bᵣ₋₁) = Σ [kᵢ ln pᵢ + (nᵢ - kᵢ) ln(1 - pᵢ)]
```
Where:
- `bᵢ` = bucket boundaries
- `nᵢ` = records in bucket i
- `kᵢ` = defaults in bucket i
- `pᵢ = kᵢ/nᵢ` = default probability

**Algorithm:** Greedy Optimization with Dynamic Programming
```python
def optimize_boundaries_greedy(df, n_buckets, n_iterations=50):
    # Initialize with quantile-based boundaries
    # Iteratively adjust to maximize log-likelihood
    # Return optimal bucket configuration
```

**Model Selection:**
- **AIC:** `2k - 2LL` (penalizes complexity)
- **BIC:** `k ln(n) - 2LL` (stronger penalty)
- **Optimal:** 7-10 buckets balancing granularity vs. overfitting

**Business Impact:** Enables categorical ML models while preserving credit risk signal
