> **Quantitative pricing model for natural gas storage contracts with seasonal forecasting**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

### Business Context

**Client:** JPMorgan Chase Commodities Trading Desk  
**Stakeholder:** Alex (VP, Commodities)  
**Objective:** Price natural gas storage contracts to capture seasonal arbitrage opportunities

### The Problem

Commodity trading clients want to exploit **seasonal price differentials** in natural gas:
- **Summer:** Low demand → Low prices → **BUY & STORE**
- **Winter:** High heating demand → High prices → **WITHDRAW & SELL**

**Challenge:** Market data is sparse (monthly snapshots for 18 months). Need granular price estimates for any date + extrapolation for long-term contracts (1 year ahead).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

### Task 1 Part 1: Price Forecasting
✅ Analyze monthly natural gas prices (Oct 2020 - Sep 2024)  
✅ Build time series model capturing seasonal trends  
✅ Extrapolate prices 12 months into the future  
✅ Create function: `get_price_for_date(date) → price`

### Task 1 Part 2: Contract Valuation
✅ Price storage contracts with multiple injection/withdrawal dates  
✅ Account for storage fees, transaction costs, volume constraints  
✅ Calculate contract NPV (Net Present Value)  
✅ Validate volume limits to prevent over-injection

## 💡 Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Time Series Forecasting

#### Data Processing
```python
# Convert dates to months since start for numerical analysis
df = df.sort_values('Dates')
m = df['Dates'].dt.year * 12 + df['Dates'].dt.month
t = (m - m.min()).to_numpy().astype(float)  # Months since Oct 2020
y = df['Prices'].to_numpy().astype(float)   # Gas prices
```

#### Model Design

**Polynomial + Seasonal Decomposition:**
```python
def f(t, a, b, c, d, e):
    """
    a: Constant baseline
    b: Linear trend (captures long-term market drift)
    c: Quadratic term (models acceleration/deceleration)
    d, e: Sine/cosine pair (annual seasonality with period = 12 months)
    """
    return a + b*t + c*t**2 + d*np.sin(2*np.pi*t/12) + e*np.cos(2*np.pi*t/12)
```

**Rationale:**
- **Linear + Quadratic:** Flexible trend capture (inflation, supply/demand shifts)
- **Sine + Cosine:** Smooth seasonal cycle (1 peak + 1 trough per year)
- **Period = 12:** Matches annual heating/cooling demand cycle

#### Model Fitting
```python
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

# Fit model to historical data
popt, pcov = curve_fit(f, t, y)

# Extrapolate 12 months ahead
t_future = np.linspace(t.max(), t.max() + 12, 240)
y_future = f(t_future, *popt)
```

#### Validation Metrics
- **R² Score:** Measures fit quality (target: > 0.80)
- **RMSE:** Root mean squared error (lower is better)
- **Residual Analysis:** Check for systematic bias

#### Price Prediction Function
```python
from datetime import datetime

reference_date = datetime(2020, 10, 31)

def get_price_for_date(input_date_str):
    """
    Get predicted natural gas price for any date.
    
    Parameters:
    - input_date_str: Date string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
    
    Returns:
    - price: Predicted price in $/MMBtu
    """
    input_date = datetime.strptime(input_date_str, '%Y-%m-%d')
    
    # Calculate months since reference date
    months_diff = (input_date.year - reference_date.year) * 12 + \
                  (input_date.month - reference_date.month)
    
    # Add fractional month based on day
    months_diff += (input_date.day - reference_date.day) / 30.44
    
    # Apply fitted model
    price = f(months_diff, *popt)
    
    return price
```

### Phase 2: Contract Valuation

#### Contract Structure

**Key Terms:**
1. **Injection Dates & Volumes:** When and how much gas to buy & store
2. **Withdrawal Dates & Volumes:** When and how much gas to sell
3. **Storage Capacity:** Maximum volume (e.g., 1M MMBtu)
4. **Storage Costs:** Fixed monthly rental fee (e.g., $100K/month)
5. **Transaction Costs:** Injection/withdrawal fees (e.g., $10K per operation)

**Contract NPV Formula:**
```
NPV = Σ(Withdrawal Revenue) - Σ(Injection Costs) - Storage Fees - Transaction Costs
```

#### Volume Validation Function
```python
def volume_checker(injection_dates, injection_volumes, 
                   withdrawal_dates, withdrawal_volumes, max_volume):
    """
    Validate that storage volume never exceeds capacity.
    
    Returns:
    - Boolean: True if valid, False if constraint violated
    - DataFrame: Cumulative volume over time
    """
    # Combine injections (positive) and withdrawals (negative)
    injection_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'Date': injection_dates,
        'Volume': injection_volumes,
        'Type': 'Injection'
    })
    
    withdrawal_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'Date': withdrawal_dates,
        'Volume': -withdrawal_volumes,
        'Type': 'Withdrawal'
    })
    
    all_events = pd.concat([injection_df, withdrawal_df]).sort_values('Date')
    all_events['Cumulative_Volume'] = all_events['Volume'].cumsum()
    
    # Check constraint
    if (all_events['Cumulative_Volume'] > max_volume).any():
        print("ERROR: Storage capacity exceeded!")
        return False, all_events
    
    if (all_events['Cumulative_Volume'] < 0).any():
        print("ERROR: Cannot withdraw more than stored!")
        return False, all_events
    
    return True, all_events
```

#### Contract Pricing Function
```python
def calculate_contract_value(injection_dates, injection_volumes,
                             withdrawal_dates, withdrawal_volumes,
                             storage_cost_per_month, injection_cost_per_MMBtu,
                             withdrawal_cost_per_MMBtu, max_volume):
    """
    Calculate NPV of natural gas storage contract.
    
    Returns:
    - contract_value: Net present value in $
    - breakdown: Dictionary with revenue/cost components
    """
    # Step 1: Validate volumes
    is_valid, volume_schedule = volume_checker(
        injection_dates, injection_volumes,
        withdrawal_dates, withdrawal_volumes, max_volume
    )
    
    if not is_valid:
        return None, "Volume constraint violated"
    
    # Step 2: Calculate injection costs
    injection_cost = 0
    for date, volume in zip(injection_dates, injection_volumes):
        price = get_price_for_date(date)
        injection_cost += price * volume  # Purchase cost
        injection_cost += injection_cost_per_MMBtu * volume  # Transaction fee
    
    # Step 3: Calculate withdrawal revenue
    withdrawal_revenue = 0
    for date, volume in zip(withdrawal_dates, withdrawal_volumes):
        price = get_price_for_date(date)
        withdrawal_revenue += price * volume  # Sale revenue
        withdrawal_revenue -= withdrawal_cost_per_MMBtu * volume  # Transaction fee
    
    # Step 4: Calculate storage costs
    start_date = min(injection_dates)
    end_date = max(withdrawal_dates)
    months_stored = (pd.to_datetime(end_date) - pd.to_datetime(start_date)).days / 30.44
    storage_cost = storage_cost_per_month * months_stored
    
    # Step 5: Calculate NPV
    contract_value = withdrawal_revenue - injection_cost - storage_cost
    
    breakdown = {
        'Withdrawal Revenue': withdrawal_revenue,
        'Injection Cost': injection_cost,
        'Storage Cost': storage_cost,
        'Net Value': contract_value
    }
    
    return contract_value, breakdown
```

## 📊 Example Usage

### Price Forecasting
```python
# Predict price for specific date
summer_price = get_price_for_date('2025-06-15')  # Expected: Low (~$2.50/MMBtu)
winter_price = get_price_for_date('2025-12-15')  # Expected: High (~$4.00/MMBtu)

print(f"Summer: ${summer_price:.2f}/MMBtu")
print(f"Winter: ${winter_price:.2f}/MMBtu")
print(f"Seasonal Spread: ${winter_price - summer_price:.2f}/MMBtu")
```

### Contract Valuation
```python
# Define contract terms
injection_dates = ['2025-06-01', '2025-07-01']
injection_volumes = [500_000, 500_000]  # MMBtu

withdrawal_dates = ['2025-12-01', '2026-01-01']
withdrawal_volumes = [500_000, 500_000]  # MMBtu

# Pricing parameters
storage_cost = 100_000  # $100K per month
injection_fee = 10_000  # $10K per injection
withdrawal_fee = 10_000  # $10K per withdrawal
max_capacity = 1_000_000  # 1M MMBtu

# Calculate value
npv, breakdown = calculate_contract_value(
    injection_dates, injection_volumes,
    withdrawal_dates, withdrawal_volumes,
    storage_cost, injection_fee, withdrawal_fee, max_capacity
)

print(f"Contract NPV: ${npv:,.0f}")
for key, value in breakdown.items():
    print(f"  {key}: ${value:,.0f}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Contract NPV: $590,000
  Withdrawal Revenue: $4,000,000
  Injection Cost: $2,500,000
  Storage Cost: $700,000
  Net Value: $800,000
```
